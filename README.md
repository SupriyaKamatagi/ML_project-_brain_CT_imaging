The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, is utilized for practicing machine learning models. 
Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) diagnosis and analysis are primarily based on brain CT scans. 
Due to the critical nature of ICH cases, prompt treatment is essential. This requires swift and precise evaluation of CT images to develop customized treatment plans.
Nevertheless, the intricate nature of ICH CT images combined with the limited availability of specialized radiologists presents notable challenges. 
This model helps address these issues by classifying ICH into three categories based on the location of the hemorrhage: Deep, Subcortical, and Lobar.
